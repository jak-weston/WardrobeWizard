Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07346

## Project Overview
WardrobeWizard is an AI-powered fashion manipulation system that uses advanced deep learning techniques to modify clothing styles in images based on text descriptions. The project implements a two-stage GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture for precise clothing manipulation while preserving the person's identity.

## Key Features
- **Text-Guided Image Manipulation**: Transform clothing styles based on natural language descriptions
- **Two-Stage Generation**:
  - Shape Generation: Creates segmentation masks for desired clothing
  - Image Generation: Generates realistic clothing while preserving identity
- **Identity Preservation**: Maintains facial features and hair during clothing transformation
- **Conditional Generation**: Supports multiple clothing types and styles

## Technical Implementation
1. Reimplement G_shape GAN
   1. Create Data loader for training loop
   2. Implement GAN structure (generator / discriminator)
   3. Train
   4. Test
2. Reimplement G_image

### Architecture
- **Shape Generator**: Creates semantic segmentation masks from text descriptions
- **Image Generator**: Transforms segmentation masks into realistic clothing
- **Discriminators**: Ensure realistic and accurate generation for both stages
- **Conditional Inputs**: 
  - Text embeddings for style description
  - Segmentation masks for clothing regions
  - Noise vectors for style variation

### Model Components
